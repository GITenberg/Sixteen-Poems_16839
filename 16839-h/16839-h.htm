<span class="i0">Adieu to Belashanny!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">where I was bred and born;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go where I may, I'll think of you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">as sure as night and morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kindly spot, the friendly town,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">where every one is known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a face in all the place<br /></span>
<span class="i2">but partly seems my own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's not a house or window,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">there's not a field or hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, east or west, in foreign lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll recollect them still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I leave my warm heart with you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">tho' my back I'm forced to turn&mdash;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span><span class="i0">No more on pleasant evenings<br /></span>
<span class="i2">we'll saunter down the Mall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the trout is rising to the fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">the salmon to the fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boat comes straining on her net,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and heavily she creeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast off, cast off&mdash;she feels the oars,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and to her berth she sweeps;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now fore and aft keep hauling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and gathering up the clew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till a silver wave of salmon<br /></span>
<span class="i2">rolls in among the crew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they may sit, with pipes a-lit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and many a joke and 'yarn';&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From Portnasun to Bulliebawns,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and round the Abbey Bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From rocky Inis Saimer<br /></span>
<span class="i2">to Coolnargit sandhills gray;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">from the Point to Mullaghmore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Killybegs to bold Slieve-League,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">that ocean-mountain steep,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">six hundred in the deep,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Head out to sea when on your lee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">the breakers you discern!&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">your summer crowds that run<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
<span class="i0">From inland homes to see with joy<br /></span>
<span class="i2">th' Atlantic-setting sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To breathe the buoyant salted air,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and sport among the waves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gather shells on sandy beach,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and tempt the gloomy caves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch the flowing, ebbing tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">the boats, the crabs, the fish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young men and maids to meet and smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and form a tender wish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sick and old in search of health,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">for all things have their turn&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">and ivy-shaded creek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sloping fields, the lofty rocks,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Lough, that winds through islands<br /></span>
<span class="i2">under Turaw mountain green;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">with tranquil bays between;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>

<span class="i2">and banks with wild flowers gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The girls will bring their work and sing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">beneath a twisted thorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or stray with sweethearts down the path<br /></span>
<span class="i2">among the growing corn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the river-side they go,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">where I have often been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, never shall I see again<br /></span>
<span class="i2">the happy days I've seen!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand chances are to one<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I never may return,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adieu to Belashanny,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and the winding banks of Erne!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Adieu to evening dances,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">when merry neighbours meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fiddle says to boys and girls,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Get up and shake your feet!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To 'seanachas' and wise old talk<br /></span>
<span class="i2">of Erin's days gone by&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
<span class="i0">Who trench'd the rath on such a hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and where the bones may lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of saint, or king, or warrior chief;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">with tales of fairy power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tender ditties sweetly sung<br /></span>
<span class="i2">to pass the twilight hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mournful song of exile<br /></span>
<span class="i2">is now for me to learn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adieu, my dear companions<br /></span>
<span class="i2">on the winding banks of Erne!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now measure from the Commons down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">to each end of the Purt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the Abbey, Moy, and Knather,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wish no one any hurt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Main Street, Back Street, College Lane,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">the Mall, and Portnasun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any foes of mine are there,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I pardon every one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hope that man and womankind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">will do the same by me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my heart is sore and heavy<br /></span>
<span class="i2">at voyaging the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My loving friends I'll bear in mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and often fondly turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think of Belashanny,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and the winding banks of Erne.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span><span class="i0">If ever I'm a money'd man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I mean, please God, to cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My golden anchor in the place<br /></span>
<span class="i2">where youthful years were pass'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though heads that now are black and brown<br /></span>
<span class="i2">must meanwhile gather gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New faces rise by every hearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and old ones drop away&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet dearer still that Irish hill<br /></span>
<span class="i2">than all the world beside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's home, sweet home, where'er I roam<br /></span>
<span class="i2">through lands and waters wide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the Lord allows me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I surely will return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my native Belashanny,<br /></span>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
